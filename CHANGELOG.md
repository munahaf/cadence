## [1.2.7] - 2024-02-09
See [Release Note](https://github.com/uber/cadence/releases/tag/v1.2.7) for details
### Upgrade notes
Cadence repo now has multiple submodules,
the split and explanation in [PR](https://github.com/uber/cadence/pull/5609).

In principle, "plugins" are "optional" and we should not be forcing all optional dependencies on all users of any of Cadence.
Splitting dependencies into choose-your-own-adventure submodules is simply good library design for the ecosystem, and it's something we should be doing more of.

## [1.2.6] - 2023-12-14
### Added
- Added range query support for Pinot json index (#5426)
- Implemented GetTaskListSize method at persistence layer (#5442, #5447)
- Added a framework for the Task validator service (#5446)
- Added nit comments describing the Update workflow cycle (#5432)
- Added log user query param (#5437)
- Added CODEOWNERS file (#5453)
- Added a function to evict all elements older than the cache TTL (#5464)

### Fixed
- Fixed workflow replication for reset workflow (#5412)
- Fixed visibility mode for admin when use Pinot visibility (#5441)
- Fixed workflow started metric (#5443)
- Fixed timer-fixer, unfortunately broken in 1.2.5 (#5433)
- Fixed confusing comment in matching handler (#5450)

### Changed
- Cassandra version is changed from 3.11 to 4.1.3 (#5461)
  - If your machine already has ubercadence/server:master-auto-setup image then you need to repull so it works with latest docker-compose*.yml files
- Move dynamic ratelimiter to its own file (#5451)
- Create and use a limiter struct instead of just passing a function (#5454)

- Update github action for image publishing to released (#5460)

### Removed
- Get rid of noisy task adding failure log in matching service (#5445)

## [1.2.5] - 2023-11-01

### Caution:

Prefer 1.2.4 or 1.2.6 if you have enabled the timer fixer.
These were broken by #5361, and fixed by #5433.

By default this fixer is _disabled_, so the version has not been retracted.

If you have already upgraded to 1.2.5, downgrading or using 1.2.6 should restore the timer fixer.
Or apply #5433 as a local patch.

### Added
- Scanner / Fixer changes (#5361)
  - Stale-workflow detection and cleanup added to shardscanner, disabled by default.
  - New dynamic config to better control scanner and fixer, particularly for concrete executions.
  - Documentation about how scanner/fixer work and how to control them, see [the scanner readme.md](service/worker/scanner/README.md)
    - This also includes example config to enable the new fixer.
- MigrationChecker interface to expose migration CLI (#5424)
- Added Pinot as new visibility store option (#5201)
  - Added pinot visibility triple manager to provide options to write to both ES and Pinot.
  - Added pinotVisibilityStore and pinotClient to support CRUD operations for Pinot.
  - Added pinot integration test to set up Pinot test cluster and test Pinot functionality.

### Fixed
- Fix CreateWorkflowModeContinueAsNew for SQL (#5413)
- Fix CLI count&list workflows error message (#5417)
- Hotfix for async matching for isolation-group redirection (#5423)
- Fix closeStatus for --format flag (#5422)

### Upgrade notes
- Any "concrete execution" or "timers" fixers run on upgrade may be missing the new config and those activities will have no invariants for a single run.  Later runs will work normally. (#5361)

## [1.0.0] - 2023-04-26
See [Release Note](https://github.com/uber/cadence/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

## [0.23.1] - 2021-11-18
See [Release Note](https://github.com/uber/cadence/releases/tag/v0.23.1)

## [0.21.3] - 2021-07-17
### Added
- Added GRPC support. Cadence server will accept requests on both TChannel and GRPC. With dynamic config flag `system.enableGRPCOutbound` it will also switch to GRPC communication internally between server components.

### Fixed
- This change contains breaking change on user config. The masterClusterName config key is deprecated and is replaced with primaryClusterName key. (#4185)

### Changed
- Bump CLI version to v0.19.0
- Change `--connect-attributes` in `cadence-sql-tool` from URL encoding to the format of k1=v1,k2=v2...
- Change `--domain_data` in `cadence domain update/register` from the format of k1:v1,k2:v2... to the format of k1=v1,k2=v2...
- Deprecate local domains. All new domains should be created as global domains.
- Server will deep merge configuration files when loading. No need to copy the whole config section, specify only those fields that needs overriding. (#4165)
